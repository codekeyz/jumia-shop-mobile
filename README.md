Inspired by the [Jumia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jumia.android) and
[Tonaton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tonaton) Mobile Apps, I decided to build this clone for my full blown [**Flutter Pro Course on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHQrb1WF9CVPyMda5CTuxih86PRnc4RVh),
